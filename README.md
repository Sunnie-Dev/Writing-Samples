# About Me
I live at the junction where Art meets Science. With diplomas in Computer Science and Technology, ECommerce, Game Art and Animation, I enjoy creating and building solutions. I am an avid dog lover, tree hugger and participate on a number of community boards. You can usually find me, at home in my head.
